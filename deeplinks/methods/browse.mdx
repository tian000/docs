# Browse

Deeplinks provide a convenient way for users to open web apps within Phantom. Using their phone’s camera, users can scan a QR code to open a page directly within Phantom’s in-app browser. If a web app detects that a user is on mobile, it can also prompt the user to open a specific page within Phantom's in-app browser.

The `browse` deeplink can be used before a [Connect](/provider-methods/connect) event takes places, as it does not require a `session` param. Please review [Extension & Mobile Browser](broken-reference) for more information on how apps can interact with Phantom from within the in-app browser.

{% hint style="info" %}
`browse` deeplinks are not intended to be pasted into mobile web browsers. These deeplinks must either be handled by an app or clicked on by an end user.
{% endhint %}
