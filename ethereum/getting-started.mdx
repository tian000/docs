# Getting Started

The Phantom browser extension and mobile in-app browser are both designed to interact with web applications. \
\
To interact with Phantom, you will go through the provider object that Phantom injects into the browser. This provider is globally available at `window.ethereum` and its methods will always include Phantom's most up-to-date functionality. The `ethereum` object can also be accessed from `window.phantom` to prevent namespace collisions. This documentation is dedicated to covering all aspects of the provider.
