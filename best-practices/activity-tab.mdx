# Displaying Apps within the Activity Tab

When a user views their historical activity, Phantom will parse their dApp interactions and enrich them with known metadata. The following are two examples of how Phantom displays historical transactions on Magic Eden and Jupiter, respectively:

To enable this, DApp developers can send an email to [developers@phantom.app](mailto:developers@phantom.app) with the following information:

1. URL of the Website
2. Display name of the dApp
3. Program/Contract IDs
4. Interaction names (corresponding to program IDs)
